The story
From the ancient clay tablets, unearthed in Anatolia by the hands of archaeologists, have revealed the tales of the Gods of this mighty people who dwelt more than three millennia ago, between 1650 and 1180 before the common era.

The Hittites cherished the telling of tales during rituals and holy feasts, to unveil the origins of their customs.

Behold some of these myths, whose beginnings fade into the mists of yore, through their very own words, inscribed upon the tablets: the myth of the dragon, that of the vanished God, and the tale of his daughter.

Through these sacred narratives, the Hittites honored their Gods, making offerings and reenacting the struggles between divine beings, beasts, and mortals. Every verse was a bridge to the divine realm, ensuring the worldâ€™s balance and the favor of those who dwelt above.

Illuyanka: A Hittite Story is an epic interactive journey set in the ancient world of the Hittites, where you can step into the roles of three powerful figures: Taru, the vengeful Storm God; Inara, his resourceful daughter; or Illuyanka, the mighty serpent. Each choice leads to a unique perspective on this timeless myth, filled with emotional depth, cultural richness, and intense conflict.

As Taru, you seek to reclaim your honor by vanquishing your old foe, Illuyanka, despite being blinded by rage and driven by the need for revenge. As Inara, you balance loyalty to your father with your own desires, weaving a plan that could either save your people or tear your heart apart. And as Illuyanka, you stand as the embodiment of raw, untamed nature, struggling to maintain your hold against the gods.

Explore Hittite traditions, navigate divine politics, and experience the weight of decisions that shape both the human and divine realms. Will you restore balance to the land, or will chaos reign? The fate of Hatti is in your hands.

Your choices shall shape the tale, yet you may always return or begin anew, perchance adopting another guise. Enjoy your journey, for the very act of recounting these ancient stories binds you to the age-old tradition of the bards and priests who first gave them voice.
