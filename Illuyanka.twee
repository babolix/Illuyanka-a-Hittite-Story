<h1>The Scribe’s Scroll</h1>
<h5>About the author this game</h5>
<p>The myth of the monster [[Illuyanka->Gods and Mortals]] is one of the oldest and most cherished among those narrated by the Hittite people, who flourished in Anatolia between 1650 and 1180 before the common era.</p>
<p>It was recounted, as here, in at least three versions, among those that have reached us, inscribed upon clay tablets, and is the foundation of the spring religious festival of <em>[[Purulli</em>->Hittite Traditions]]</em>, the details of which remain largely unknown, but we do know that the text was recited publicly by priests before the king and the people gathered from all the land, as a prayer or a song.</p>
<p>The present version has been entirely crafted, for both text and images, by the scribe <a href="http://beatricebarberis.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Maria Beatrice Barberis</a>, an expert in ancient (archaeology and languages) and modern (programming and graphics, among others) subjects, drawing the original text from <a href="https://archive.org/details/ac.f.pecchiolidaddia.m.polvanilamitologiaittita" target="_blank">F. Pecchioli Daddi, A.M. Polvani, <em>La mitologia ittita</em>, Paideia Editrice, Brescia 1990</a>.</p>

Then, with deliberate cruelty, it gouges your eyes, leaving you in total darkness. The agony is overwhelming, but worse than the pain is the knowledge that the monster has taken from you all that makes you a warrior—a God. Your heart and sight are ripped away, your pride shattered beyond repair.]</p>

<h1 style="padding-bottom:24px;">Hittite Mindset and Traditions</h1>
<details><summary id="Hittites"><h5>The Hittite Kingdom</h5></summary>
<p  class="accordion-content">The Hittite Kingdom, which thrived in Anatolia (now Turkey) froma bout 1600–1180 BC, was a significant power in the ancient Near East. Renowned for its advanced culture and military prowess, the kingdom played a pivotal role in shaping regional dynamics. The Hittites, who were Indoeuropeans and wrote in both (Akkadian) cuneiform and (Luwian) hyerogliphs, were skilled diplomats, establishing alliances and treaties that influenced their survival and prosperity. Their legacy is preserved in monumental architecture, legal texts, and, notably, their rich mythological traditions that offer insight into their worldview.</p></details>

<details><summary id="Cities"><h5>Hittite Cities</h5></summary>
<p  class="accordion-content">Hittite cities were typically fortified with massive stone walls and gateways adorned with reliefs of gods, kings, and protective spirits. The cities were organized around a central acropolis, where the royal palace and major temples stood. Surrounding this core were residential areas, workshops, and smaller shrines, reflecting the blend of political, religious, and economic life. The great Hittite cities, like Hattusa, the powerful capital, and Tarhuntassa, an ancient rival center, stood at the heart of a vast empire. Hattusa, with its grand temples and fortified walls, was the seat of kings and gods alike, while Tarhuntassa, once the residence of a Hittite king, held a unique political significance. Other cities such as Samuha, an important religious center, and Kummanni, sacred to the [[Sun Goddess->Gods and Mortals]], played key roles in the empire’s spiritual and political landscape. However, cities like [[Lihzina->Hittite Traditions]], Ziggaratta, and [[Kiskilussa->Hittite Traditions]], mentioned in the myth of [[Illuyanka->Gods and Mortals]], remain enigmatic. They are not found in other known Hittite texts nor identified in the archaeological record, their names perhaps existing only in the realm of myth, passed down through sacred stories and songs.</p></details>

<details><summary id="Traditions"><h5>Hittite Traditions</h5></summary>
<p class="accordion-content">Hittite traditions were deeply intertwined with their religious beliefs, guiding their daily lives and interactions with the divine. Rituals played a crucial role, as offerings were made to appease the gods and seek their favor in matters of agriculture, health, and warfare. Festivals celebrated the changing seasons, reinforcing the connection between the people and their deities, particularly in times of hardship such as famine or natural calamities. The Hittites honored their gods through elaborate ceremonies, invoking divine intervention for prosperity, fertility, and protection against malevolent forces, all while weaving their myths into the fabric of their culture.</p></details>

<details><summary id="HarvestTradition"><h5>The Harvest Tradition</h5></summary>
<p class="accordion-content">In the time of harvest, the Hittites would gather in their fields, singing praises to the Goddess of the Harvest. They believed that her blessing was essential for a bountiful yield. The fields would be adorned with offerings of the first fruits, symbolizing gratitude and reverence. This sacred ritual connected the people to the divine, ensuring the fertility of the land and the prosperity of their households.</p></details>

<details><summary id="RitualsOfTheStorm"><h5>Rituals of the Storm</h5></summary>
<p class="accordion-content">When the storms gathered in the skies, the Hittites would prepare offerings for [[Taru->Gods and Mortals]], the Storm God. They believed that his tempestuous nature needed to be appeased to ensure safe passage through the seasons. Sacred fires were lit, and songs of praise echoed through the valleys, celebrating his power and majesty.

<p>(t8n:"fade-right")+(t8n-delay:3s)+(t8n-skip:0.2s)[This is the tale of the Hittite feast of [[<em>Purulli</em>->Hittite Traditions]], the sacred feast of spring held in honor of the supreme [[Storm God->Gods and Mortals]] of the sky, told in his own hand by Kella, priest of the Storm God of the city of Nerik, along with an invocation to the vanishing God, dating back more than 3500 years. This festival, rich in rituals and meaning, embodies the hopes and aspirations of a people who sought the favor of the divine to ensure the fertility of their land and the prosperity of their lives.]</p>
<p>(t8n:"fade-right")+(t8n-delay:6s)+(t8n-skip:0.2s)[When it is said: “May the Land flourish in prosperity and safety,” it is in order that it may indeed thrive in well-being that the ancient feast of <em>Purulli</em> is observed, established by the Hattian folk after what transpired between the Storm God Taru and the monster [[Illuyanka->Gods and Mortals]]. This timeless tradition is a celebration of resilience, a response to the adversities faced by the people, as they come together to honor their Gods, pleading for protection and blessings that would enable them to navigate the challenges of the coming year.]</p>
<p>(t8n:"fade-right")+(t8n-delay:7s)+(t8n-skip:0.2s)[For 45 days, let the Gods be venerated with prayers, processions, songs, dances, and contests of sport. Each act of devotion strengthens the bond between the divine and the mortal, ensuring the blessings of the Gods flow freely upon the land. The vibrant sounds of celebration echo through the valleys, and the flickering lights of offerings illuminate the paths as communities unite, weaving together the threads of their stories in a collective display of faith and gratitude.]</p>
<p>(t8n:"fade-right")+(t8n-delay:10s)+(t8n-skip:0.2s)[But first, let it be told how all came to pass, the intricate tale of chaos and order, light and darkness, that shapes the very fabric of existence. These events weave together the lives of Gods and mortals, revealing the enduring struggle that defines them both. The narrative unfurls like a tapestry, intricately depicting the trials faced by the deities and the mortal champions who rise to confront the chaos that threatens to engulf their world.]</p>
<p>(t8n:"fade-right")+(t8n-delay:13s)+(t8n-skip:0.2s)[Greetings to you, O faithful one, whom do you wish to hear of the ancient happenings? Each story holds a lesson, each character a role in this grand tapestry of myths that has endured through the ages. From the might of the [[Storm God->Gods and Mortals]] and his daugter, the [[Goddess of Royalty->Gods and Mortals]], to the cunning of the [[Underworld Beast->Gods and Mortals]], their tales interlace with the destinies of mortals, forming a legacy that speaks of courage, sacrifice, and the eternal quest for harmony amid discord.]</p>

With grace and fervor, they remind her of the love that binds you to her daughter, invoking the powerful ties of devotion that transcend even death.
